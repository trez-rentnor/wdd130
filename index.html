                <p> Randy is a student in the WDD 130 Web Fundamentals.  He lives in San Diego, California.
                    Randy has experience developing a range of software products, from medical devices to
                    set top boxes to web-facing microservices.  He's chosen to stop working in a full-time position
                    so he can work on his true passion, a web app for musicians.  It's shaping up to be a great app.
                    Randy is a software developer who is currenlty working on a new web app called Stavely.
                    Stavely is designed to be "Google Docs for music." It's meant to be simpler than other
                    Music Notation apps out there so you can write down inspiration when you're out and 
                    about. If you or anybody you know are into music talk to him about getting an invitation 
                    to the closed beta so you can try out his app and give feedback. Randy is running out of things
                    to say and finds it kind of strange to refer to himself in the third person.  Would you write
                    this in the first person?  Did you see how I just encouraged engagemenmt there?  That's building a 
                    community. like thos youtubers that are always yelling to smash that like button like and subscribe
                    by clicking on the bell but you can't just click on the bell you also have to subscribe to all 
                    notifications and even then you might not get all the notifications.
